# Tournament Speed Configuration Test

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented different speeds for tournament matches:

### Speed Settings:
- **Semi-finals (matchNum: '1' or '2')**: Medium speed
  - `ballSpeed: 5`
  - `paddleSpeed: 7`
  - Same as regular 1v1 games and medium AI difficulty

- **Final match (matchNum: 'final')**: Very fast speed
  - `ballSpeed: 8`
  - `paddleSpeed: 10`
  - Same as hard AI difficulty

### Code Changes Made:

1. **TournamentModal.ts**: Added speed detection based on match type
   ```typescript
   // Set game speed based on match type (semi-final vs final)
   if (matchNum === 'final') {
     (window as any).tournamentGameSpeed = 'very-fast';
   } else {
     (window as any).tournamentGameSpeed = 'medium';
   }
   ```

2. **gamePage.ts**: Applied speed configuration during game creation
   ```typescript
   const tournamentSpeed = (window as any).tournamentGameSpeed;
   if (tournamentSpeed === 'very-fast') {
     gameConfig = { ballSpeed: 8, paddleSpeed: 10 };
   } else if (tournamentSpeed === 'medium') {
     gameConfig = { ballSpeed: 5, paddleSpeed: 7 };
   }
   ```

3. **Cleanup**: Tournament speed setting is cleaned up after the match ends

### How to Test:
1. Start a tournament with 4 players
2. Play the semi-final matches - they should feel like regular 1v1 games (medium speed)
3. Play the final match - it should be noticeably faster and more challenging

The implementation ensures that the game difficulty progressively increases as players advance through the tournament bracket, making the final match a true test of skill at high speed.
